Generate __sce_ebootpbp for the vita

This file is used to verify EBOOT.pbp files on the Vita to prevent tampering and is also used for version checking.

To generate a __sce_ebootpbp, you must have obtained your AID. One method of obtaining your AID is to copy it from an existing __sce_ebootpbp at offset 0x40 to 0x48 from a hex editor.


	CMD LINE (*): ./chovy-gen <your aid ex: 0x123456789ABCDEF0> <EBOOT.pbp> 
	*You use a thing command prompt, to find that, you use a thing called Google
